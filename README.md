# Session-Storage-Skeleton
This is a basic session storage skeleton for your website. If you are using node.js as the back-end for your website and you want your users to be able to view their user-strict contents you can use this as your session skeleton. Be aware though you need to edit this codes according to your database order. This only a skeleton for a session management.
